# TODOS

- [ ] Rename all of the important files starting with dot and remove the dot (move these files to a location such that Meteor does not import them)
- [ ] Accept `.tsv` files (prefer from `.tab`)
- [ ] Remove `recompose`
- [ ] Make dragging of `inputs` folder possible
- [ ] Make dragging of `outputs` folder possible
- [ ] Run a diffing algorithm if an existing project gets updated to only update those files which have been modified
